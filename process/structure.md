## Content Stream
Content stream is a set of teams which helps us to keep our content up-to-date, create new study materials and support students. 
Each team is meant to be in charge of specific stage.

### Responsibilities
Responsibilities are listed for each team within this stream.
* Keep the content up-to-date
  * Update study materials to contain actual links
  * Resolve issues found by students, mentors, experts, etc.
  * Apply production experience to study materials to make sure content fits production needs.
  * Keep AutoCode programs up-to-date
* Create new study materials
  * Cover gaps in our materials
* Support students in our chats

### Roles
* **Content Creator** - a person who is dealing with content creation & updates, AutoCode maintenance. Stage Coordinator role might be used by mature Software Engineers or Senior Software Engineers as a good starting point to grow as a leader. It is also a great chance to learn something new or recap already gain knowledge.
* **Stage Driver** - a person who drives the whole stage, helps to resolve impediments. De-facto a scrum master for other team members. Content Creator role is a good role for volunteers who are mature engineers and would like to make their ideas come true. Content creation is not only about some study materials, this could also be some videos, etc. **This is one of two starting points to join the school for the majority of engineers**.
* **Expert** - a person who supports students in chats or via various events and communication channels, helps to keep AutoCode up-to-date. The last, but not the least is a very important role of Expert - this is a good chance to join the school for less mature engineers with production experience. This is a great option if you'd like to promote your mentoring and knowledge sharing skills to a new level.

## Stakeholders
We identify three main stakeholders for our School:
* **Resource Development** - EPAM department which is responsible for students' education. We serve them as a black-box service which helps with education process realization. At the same time, RD helps us with administrative stuff and offers possible employment options for students. 
* **Production** - EPAM projects and departments. We serve them as a source of new engineers who fits their demand. At the same time they help us with promotion to attract new contributors.
* **MJC** - a main community. We serve them as a source of new community members. At the same time they serve us as a source of contributors. However, it is incorrect to say that MJC School and MJC are two different entities. We're both partsof a big common community.
